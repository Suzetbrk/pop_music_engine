# pop_music_engine
 
Attempt to build a search engine for a pop music website. The search engine works as follows. Once a user types the name of a pop star, the search engine will print out a list
of songs that the singer performs. Similar to Google, the user interface should provide suggested names for pop stars. That is, once the user types a few characters, the search engine should be able to give all the names starting with the typed characters. By clicking on one of the suggested names, a list of songs sung by the chosen singer should be printed.
